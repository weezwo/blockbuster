# Blockbuster

A simple implementation of the classic brickbreaker game in vanilla js with rudimentary physics.

## Notable Features

- No js or css animation! It's all just div elements moved about with css positioning! 
- Velocity transfer to ball from paddle on the x-axis!
- Every hit brick increases ball velocity on the y-axis!
- Bricks positioned on css grid! 
- Brick display is governed entirely by css rules via data attributes! 
- I think it works on mobile!
- Theming vaguely reminiscent of a defunct media rental empire!
- Infinite play!
- Reset the game with the space bar!
- Why am I yelling?!
